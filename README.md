# Wordpress to Epub  

I always feel in the need to read something else, so I usually check translations online.  
One of my favorite series had a new arc but it sucks to read online. I'm usually a a patron of such translation groups, so why do I have to go through the website to read?  

## Scrapper to HTML compatible (with pictures!)  

The task was to create a scrapper that navigates through the post on the same novel and story arc. We did that with the next button and some logic.  
The script downloads the text on the main html block, <article>. It tries to get rid of the intro as well, works most of the times.  
It also gets the arts that are posted along the translation, even the social media ones.  
With the result file you can just open it on Calibre and it's ready to convert to epub.  

The sample is provided with Arc 7 of the Re:zero novel. Please back their translation project or whoever is behind the work you download.
